# Slot-Machine
This is the implementation of a slot machine game. There are three cases in which a random letter appears and the user wins if in each case appears the same letter. The user starts with 100 dollars and before the spin he must enter a valid amount to bet. If the user wins, the bet ammount is doubled and added to the total sum of money. If the total sum becomes 0 the game ends and it can be restarted.
