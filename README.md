# Slot-Machine
This is the implementation of a slot machine game. There are three cases in which a random letter between A, B and C appears and, if in each case appears the same letter, the user wins. The user starts with 100 dollars and before the spin he must enter a valid amount to bet. If the user wins, the bet ammount is doubled and added to the total sum of money. If the total sum becomes 0 the game ends.
