# Slot-Machine
This is the implementation of a slot machine game with three cases. Firstly, the program selects two random capital letters. Afterwards, it randomly selects a letter between these two in order to fill each case. The user wins if in each case appears the same letter. The user starts with 100 dollars and before every spin he must enter a valid amount to bet. If the user wins, the bet ammount is doubled and added to the total sum of money. If the total sum becomes 0 the game ends and it can be restarted.
